/*
 * FILE DOCUMENTATION
 * Where: src/Haven.Core/DomainLogic/HavenSurface.cs, in the dependency-free Core layer, where shared domain models and rules live.
 * What: This file owns HavenSurface. Read the type and member comments below as a map of each responsibility.
 * How: Public members form the callable contract; private members hold implementation details; asynchronous members carry cancellation through I/O.
 * Why: This code stays free of UI and storage dependencies so the same rule or data shape can be reused and tested everywhere.
 * Maintenance: Preserve the layer boundary, nullability annotations, cancellation flow, and existing public signatures when changing this file.
