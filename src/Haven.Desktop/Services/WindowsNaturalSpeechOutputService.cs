/*
 * FILE DOCUMENTATION
 * Where: src/Haven.Desktop/Services/WindowsNaturalSpeechOutputService.cs, in the Desktop services layer, adapting application behavior to Windows and Avalonia concerns.
 * What: This file owns WindowsNaturalSpeechOutputService, PlaybackState. Read the type and member comments below as a map of each responsibility.
 * How: Public members form the callable contract; private members hold implementation details; asynchronous members carry cancellation through I/O.
 * Why: The file keeps one cohesive responsibility in a predictable location so callers can find and replace it without unrelated changes.
 * Maintenance: Preserve the layer boundary, nullability annotations, cancellation flow, and existing public signatures when changing this file.
